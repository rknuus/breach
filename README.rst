An experimental decryption assistant supporting you in solving GeoCaching mysteries based
on encryption. Use at own risk.


Description
===========

Some GeoCaching mystery caches require you to crack encrypted data to find the final
coordinates (see http://www.geocaching.com). The tool eventually should support cracking of
some simple (and inherently insecure) codes and ciphers. Some procedures might be fully
automated, others interactive, and some require the correct key.

In plain English (inspired by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_EasyFlow):
What ever YOU do with the tool, YOU are fully liable for using of the tool, including all
consequences. This means basically the same as most disclaimers that come with software
packages. If you don't like this disclaimer: tough. We reserve the right to do the absolute
minimum provided by law, up to and including nothing.
