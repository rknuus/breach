An experimental decryption assistant supporting you in solving GeoCaching mysteries based
on encryption. Use at own risk.


Description
===========

Some GeoCaching mystery caches require you to crack encrypted data to find the final
coordinates (see http://www.geocaching.com). The tool eventually should support cracking of
some simple (and inherently insecure) codes and ciphers. Some procedures might be fully
automated, others interactive, and some require the correct key.
